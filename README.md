Wolfpack-Zel | Climate Change Project

This project analyzes the climate change trend globally as well as in top 5 high GDPs, top 5 low GDPs and top 5 highly affected countries.

Datasets:
A Kaggle climate change dataset (5 file sets): data from 1770s through 2013
GDP dataset (Worldbank.org): data from 1960s through 2018
Used GDP data set to find the 5 countries with high GDPs and 5 countries with low GDPs.
We concluded our refined research topic by referring to result from GDP data set to filter out data from “GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry” file of climate change data set which included all the necessary information.
Used Python programming language in the Jupyter notebook to clean, concat and reshape the data
Removed the parenthesis from values and aggregated the rows.
Changed data types (e.g., objects to datetime)
Used Tableau to create the graphs and visualize
